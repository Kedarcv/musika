   - Cyclomatic complexity measurement
   - Code quality metrics
   - Design pattern detection

2. Research Tools
   - Code execution time profiling
   - Memory usage analysis
   - Algorithm complexity visualization
   - Code similarity detection

3. Educational Components
   - Interactive Python tutorial integration
   - Real-time syntax explanation
   - Best practices suggestions
   - Design pattern recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- **UI Layer**: Implemented using tkinter and ttkthemes
- **Code Analysis Engine**: Built on ast and jedi
- **Execution Environment**: Integrated Python interpreter
- **File System Manager**: Custom implementation with PathLib

### 2. Design Patterns Used
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separation of data, presentation, and logic
- **Observer Pattern**: Event handling for UI updates
- **Factory Pattern**: Creation of UI components
- **Singleton Pattern**: Configuration management
- **Strategy Pattern**: Syntax highlighting and code analysis

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Intelligent Code Completion**: Using Jedi for context-aware suggestions
- **Real-time Syntax Analysis**: Pygments-based highlighting
- **Multi-threading Support**: Non-blocking operations
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Windows/Linux/MacOS support
